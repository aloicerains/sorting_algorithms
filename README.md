### Sorting_Algorithms     
=======================     
This repository contains projects on sorting algorithms.     
Some of the sorting algorithms included include:     
* Bubble sort   
* Insertion sort   
* Selection sort    
* Quick sort   

The tasks for each of the sorting algorithms are described below.    

**Task0: Bubble sort Algorithm**    

Instructions:     
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm     
* Prototype: `void bubble_sort(int *array, size_t size);`    
* Youâ€™re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements.     
* Write in the file `0-O`, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:     
	> in the best case    
	> in the average case        
	> in the worst case
