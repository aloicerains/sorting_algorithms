### Sorting_Algorithms     
=======================     
This repository contains projects on sorting algorithms.     
Some of the sorting algorithms included include:     
* Bubble sort   
* Insertion sort   
* Selection sort    
* Quick sort

The tasks for each of the sorting algorithms are described below.    

**Task0: Bubble sort Algorithm**    

Instructions:     
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm     
* Prototype: `void bubble_sort(int *array, size_t size);`    
* You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements.     
* Write in the file `0-O`, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:     
	> in the best case    
	> in the average case        
	> in the worst case     

**Task1: Insertion sort**    
Instructions:    
Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm     
* Prototype: `void insertion_sort_list(listint_t **list);`    
* You are not allowed to modify the integer n of a node. You have to swap the nodes themselves.    
* You’re expected to print the list after each time you swap two elements          
* Write in the file 1-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Insertion sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:   
	>in the best case    
	>in the average case    
	>in the worst case    

**Task2: Selection sort**    
Instructions:    
* Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm  
* Prototype: `void selection_sort(int *array, size_t size);`    
* You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements    
* The time complexities in best avarage and worst cases must be included.     

**Task3: Quick Sort**     
Instructions:    
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm     
* Prototype: `void quick_sort(int *array, size_t size);`       
* You must implement the Lomuto partition scheme.    
* The pivot should always be the last element of the partition being sorted.    
* You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements
